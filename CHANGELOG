v0.4.1
- Bumped version to 0.4.1
- Upgraded package dependencies (those recommended in Dependabot alerts)
- Altered Task Editor Behaviour
    - On editing tasks, the change is immediately made to local storage, before request being sent to CalDAV
    - Causes flickering in task renders, but that will have to be resolved later.
    - If the CalDAV change fails, the old version is reverted.
- Added ability to locally change calendar colours
    - No change is made to caldav. (AFAIK, tsdav doesn't support change of colour)

- Minor bug fixes
- Autosync setup - Looks like it is working
- Added user setting for autosync.
- Fixed Docker installation not working on remote hosts behind proxeis.
    - The problem started with NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL variable. Variables that start with NEXT_PUBLIC need to be set during build time, and cannot be set while running the docker image.
    - Now NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL is no longer required to be set in the .env file and will be ignored even if set.
    - The API url is now a relative URL
    - Docker images now seem to be working on host behind proxies.
- Renamed var NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_NEXT_AUTH to USE_NEXT_AUTH, for the aforementioned reasons.

# Installation: Getting Started

There are two main ways to install and run MMDL.

## With Docker
    
A docker image is available for MMDL. Installation has not been tested throughly but, as they say, "it works on my machine." Detailed instructions are available [here](Docker/index.md).

## Without Docker

To install without docker, you can follow the instructions [here](Dockerless/Install.md).

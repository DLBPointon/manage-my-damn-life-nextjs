v0.1.2.9
    - DashboardView.js -- Make sure tasks are added mutiple times
    - Added internal .env variable : NEXT_PUBLIC_VERSION_NUMBER
    - Version number is displayed in Settings page.
    - Getting project ready to support both JS and TS
        - Added tsconfig.json
    - removed npm sharp as a dependency, because with it `npm build` ends up requiring sudo in some cases.

- Upgraded all FullCalendar Dependencies
- Upgraded react-bootstrap package
- Upgrade tsdav to 2.1.2
- Fixed bug: Events were being parsed through VTODO parser, making it difficult for MMDL to recognise events from other clients. Partially fixes #165 and #179
- Calendarview: Fixed recurring events displaying the default duration of 1 hour. Now renders the correct duration. Fixes #165.
- Fixed Event edit problem with Radicale. UID being missing from Events was causing 409 CONFLICT response. Should completely fix #179.
- Fixed Copy/Move to Calendar Modal not showing on 'calendar/view/' page. Added missing "GlobalViewManager" component.
- Added some eslint rules to supress warnings.

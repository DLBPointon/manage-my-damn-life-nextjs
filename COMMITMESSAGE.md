- Fixed errors being thrown in API. The errors will now be logged into console. Will need to implement better error handling in the future.

- Fixed bug while adding recurrence rules to events. 

- Updated @fullcalendar/rrule to latest(6.1.6), and now rrule seems to be working.

- In parent task search, now the option for current task (the one that is being edited) is no longer shown.

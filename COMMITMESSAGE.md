- TaskEditor now sends the changes to CalDAV and dismissed. Result is shown later. Behaviour is consistent with EventEditor.
- Fixed update of Label cache. Labels of "done" tasks are not shown.
- Moved most of setting variables to localStorage, instead of Cookies.
- ParentTaskSearch.js now searches Dexie for parent tasks, rather than the API.
